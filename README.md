# Task Manager App

Task Manager App is a simple web application that allows users to manage their tasks. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. The app uses React for the front end, Redux for state management, and local storage for persisting tasks.

## Features

- Add new tasks: Users can enter a task description and click "Add Task" to add a new task to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking the checkbox next to each task. Completed tasks are displayed with a strike-through style.
- Delete tasks: Users can delete tasks by clicking the delete icon next to each task.
- Save tasks: Users can save tasks to local storage by clicking the "Save" button. This allows tasks to be persisted even after the browser is closed.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- FontAwesome: A library of icons for use in web projects.
- Local Storage: A web API for persisting data in the browser.
